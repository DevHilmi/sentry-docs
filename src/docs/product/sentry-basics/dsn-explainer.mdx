Sentry automatically assigns you a Data Source Name (DSN) when you create a project to start monitoring events in your app.

### What the DSN Does

A DSN tells a Sentry SDK where to send events, such that they are associated with the right project.

If this value is not provided, SDKs will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable, where applicable. This fallback does not apply in cases like a web browser, as the concept of environment variables does not exist.

If an SDK is not initialized or if it is initialized with an empty DSN, it will not send any data over the network, such as captured exceptions.

### Where to Find Your DSN

If you forget your DSN, view _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_ in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/).

### The Parts of the DSN

The DSN configures the protocol, public key, server address, and project identifier. It is composed of the following parts:

`{PROTOCOL}://{PUBLIC_KEY}:{SECRET_KEY}@{HOST}{PATH}/{PROJECT_ID}`

For example:

```javascript
Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://public@sentry.example.com/1" });
```

Has the following settings:

- URI = https://sentry.example.com
- Public Key = public
- Project ID = 1

<Note>

The secret part of the DSN is optional and effectively deprecated. While clients will still honor it, if supplied, future versions of Sentry will entirely ignore it.

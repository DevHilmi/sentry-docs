<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

The **Project Details** page provides a consolidated view of what's going on in your project. This page is useful if you have oversight over many teams and many projects. You can also use this page to set up [Alerting](/product/alerts-notifications/) or delve into the Issue stream to [triage an issue](#triage).

After selecting the time range (the default is the last 14 days), you can view:

- Crash fresh [sessions](/product/releases/health/#session)
- Release count
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- A graph of daily error and transaction events that have occurred; toggle the **Display** to change the view.

## Alerting

You can use the Project Details page to access Sentry's alerting feature. Click the **Create Alert** button at the top right to set up either an [Issue Alert](/product/alerts-notifications/issue-alerts/) or a [Metric Alert](/product/alerts-notifications/metric-alerts/).

## Triage

Use Project Details to view issues associated with this project, accessing the **Issue Details** page to triage the issue by either clicking **View All Issues** or the **Open in Issues** button located at the top of the **Project Issues** listed on the page.

## Modify Project Settings

Use the Settings icon at the top of the page to access the Project's Settings; modify as appropriate to your team and organization.

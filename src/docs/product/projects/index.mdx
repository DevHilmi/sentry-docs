A _Project_ connects the error and transaction events in your application to the team members assigned to that project.

You can create a project for a particular language or framework, and typically do so when you first start using Sentry, though you can add projects as you need. For example, you might have separate projects for your API server and frontend client. Setting up multiple projects to reflect your application landscape with finer granularity will go a long way in helping with visibility and triage.

Also, when displaying the **Issue Stream** and **Discover** views, the top-level filter bar considers the projects you are a member of by default. This way, you are looking at information that is immediately relevant to your work.

## Project Homepage

The project homepage provides a high-level overview of all your projects, including:

- All projects of which you're a member
- A snapshot of both errors and transactions
- Team members for each project
- Deploys, if you have configured your SDK to [provide a release identifier](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/)

The projects are displayed in alphabetical order, separated by team. **Note:** For faster access, star your favorites to ensure they display at the top of the page each time you view.

## View Project Details

Project details combine errors, performance, and health in one central place. The [Project Details](/product/projects/project-details/) page provides a critical overview to developers, product owners, and engineering managers to answer the central question of "What is the project's current state and where do I need to look next?".

Open Project Details by clicking the title of the project on the Projects page.
